  <h2>Hiking in the US</h2>
  <p>Hiking is cool I guess, idk. It's fun to touch grass.</p>

<script>
  $(document).ready(function() {
    yelpAPICall();
  });

<!-- 
  Plan:
  - Make a separate CSS file for any styling you need to do to elements in Info pages and include that stylesheet in Countries/index.php
  - Make a page for US hiking and do a call to Yelp Fusion API to get 5 businesses related to hiking. Display info about them (look at what the Yelp call returns) and a street view of the place
  - Do the same for a couple other activities for the US
  - Make a home page for the US that will be static (it should convince tourists to come to the US)
  - Make a history page for the US (also static info)
    - For the static pages, make sure you always link sources on the page
  
  - Update all Account pages that you made to show errors in a more pretty way
