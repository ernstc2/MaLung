My Favorite Places in France
I was shocked

I loved the Eiffel Tower. I was shocked at how big it was, with me thinking that it would be smaller than it actually was. Additionally, I had no idea that the Latin Quarter existed, so visiting that was a pleasant suprise. I also loved how they are rebuilding Notre Dame, and it is definitely worth it to take a peek at the construction.
Wow, thank you so much!
