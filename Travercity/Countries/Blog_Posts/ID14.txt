The best food places I ate at!

I loved the crepes at the Breizh Cafe so much. Like I never thought that crepes could ever turn out so good until I ate these and if you don't eat these, you are definitely missing something. I also loved La Truffiere for dinner and would love to go again if I get the chance. Additionally, Herme had great macaroons!
I will definitely get those crepes!
