Singing in and out:
one role i early on in the process toojk on was the sign in and out pages for this project, decided to sing up you needed an email and a password and to confirm the password. also included navigation between the two in case a wrong path was taken to get there individually. made css pages for each and ,ade just modern looking designs with rounded corners, box shadows and minimal colors that match wirth the rest of the site. mkaing sessions for keeping a user logged in throughout the site for blogging and other uses.

Accounts table:
siyan and i cordnitated with what details should be included with the tables correspoding to the users, while he made the tables and added other columns for personal changes to be made in the account page i only used the emails, and passwords and ids that were made. accessing this table and dealing with checking of sessions proved to be a little bit challeneging but not by too much. if i could do it over i wish i had used the same login for my local host as i did for the vm for easier testing and consistency.

Presentation:
made a standard presentation with google slides using a template linked below in sources. made the entire presenstation and cordinated with stella for changes as per request because the current plan is for the two of us to present the slides during the presentation. nothing too crazy, standard presentation, did take some insipration from first weeks presenters by adding a section for next steps.
