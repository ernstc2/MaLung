Challenges I faced
- Image sizing and consistency

What I worked on
- News Api
  - Making it work for evey country hard, I created a method to make it take the country info from the url 
  - However the news api used the country code and I didn't realise until it was too late nto make an extraction method
- Website Content and outline
  - I detailed to the team what the site shouldn contain and how the information should be presented
  - I realised it's hard to present your vision through words alone you have to visually present it
- Made website template
  - The website template for st. Lucia was what I used to present the vision for the site
