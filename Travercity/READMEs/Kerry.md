Map Initialization: Utilizes the Google Maps JavaScript API to display a map of each country on the webpage.
Upon loading, the map is centered around the approximate center of each country with an appropriate initial 
zoom level.

Point of Interest (POI) Location: Several images are provided, each representing a famous landmark in each 
country. These images are bound to the JavaScript function goToLocation through an onclick event. When a 
user clicks on any of these images, the map automatically moves and zooms in on the specific location of 
that landmark.

Style and Layout: The webpageâ€™s layout and element styles are defined through CSS. The .container class is 
used to set up the layout for the map and the list of images, while the .locations img class defines the style
of the landmark images, including size, position, and dynamic effects upon clicking.

User Interaction: By clicking on different landmark images, users can easily view the locations of each point 
of interest on the map, enhancing their interactive experience.

It provides detailed instructions on how to interact with the map, interpret the information displayed,
